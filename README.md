# CS-255 System Analysis & Design

This repository contains my complete work for **CS-255 System Analysis & Design**.  
It covers the full system design lifecycle, from requirements gathering through process and object modeling, to final integrated architecture, applied to the **DriverPass** case study and related assignments.


## Repository Structure

### **Module 1 – SDLC & Requirements Gathering**
- **1-2 Discussion SDLC and Collecting Requirements Strategies.pages**  
  Discussion on different Software Development Life Cycle approaches and strategies for collecting customer requirements.
- **1-3 Assignment Collecting Customer Requirements.docx**  
  Detailed business requirements document for the DriverPass system.



### **Module 2 – Determining Requirements**
- **2-2 Assignment Determining Requirements.docx**  
  Defines functional and non-functional requirements, user needs, and initial system scope.



### **Module 3 – Process Modeling**
- **3-1 Discussion Process Models.docx**  
  Why process models are critical for real-world systems and how they guide architecture.
- **3-2 Evaluate a Process Model.docx**  
  Step-by-step workflows for core DriverPass processes:  
  - Customer Registration  
  - Appointment Scheduling  
  - DMV Synchronization  
  - Test Administration



### **Module 4 – Object Modeling & Gantt Charts**
- **4-1 Discussion Object Models and Gantt Charts.docx**  
  Compares object vs process models, plus my implementation of a Gantt chart generator using Python + Plotly.
- **4-2 Assignment Evaluate an Object Model.docx**  
  Detailed evaluation of the DriverPass object model — strengths, weaknesses, and scalability concerns.



### **Module 5 – Functional, Structural, and Behavioral Models**
- **5-1 Discussion Functional, Structural, and Behavioral Models.pages**  
  Covers different modeling approaches and how they relate to system design.
- **5-2 Project One.zip**  
  Final integrated project deliverables — includes process and object models, diagrams, and supporting documentation.


## Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- **Process Modeling** – Sequential workflows, decision points, and branching logic
- **Object Modeling** – Class hierarchies, relationships, and encapsulation
- **Hybrid Architecture** – Combining object and process modeling with a service layer
- **UML Diagrams** – Class, sequence, activity, and state diagrams
- **Gantt Charts** – Programmatically generated with Python + Plotly
- **System Design Philosophy** – Applying professional architecture practices learned from real-world high-performance systems


## My System Design Rules
1. Architecture comes first — optimization comes after stability  
2. Clean, modular code with deep, meaningful comments  
3. Flowcharts and diagrams for every major process  
4. Consistency in logic across all layers  
5. A design that survives scaling, stress, and change



## Notes
This repo isn’t just “class assignments”, it’s a record of my **real system design workflow**.  
Many of the methods shown here reflect the same strategies I use in advanced projects, such as my SIMD-accelerated primality testing platform that outperforms GMP and GMPY2.



## Next Steps for This Repo
- Add exported PNG/PDF versions of all diagrams  
- Organize modules into `/docs` and `/uml` directories for easy navigation  
- Include screenshots of Gantt charts and UML diagrams for quick viewing  
- Add `PHILOSOPHY.md` with my detailed architecture approach
